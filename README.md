*Submission*
_Base Mode_

With what you know now, we are going to create a build that encompasses the javascript we covered today in class.
“Week 1 Array Assignment” is a name that would work well in this case.
Create a new repository on GitHub,
Create a new project (folder in this case) on your machine,
Initialize a Git repository in that project (folder),
Create an index.html and populate it with base functionality for an html page,
Create an client.js file that will serve as your functionality for your site, make sure to include comments and the function of the code you wrote. Call this function several times to get different console.logs like the examples above
Link the Javascript file to your HTML file,
Push your completed project to the new GitHub repo

_Hard Mode_

Create a README Markdown file and explain each of the files within the project

_Pro Mode_

If a user submits values that are not numbers try to convert them to numbers. So (e.g. if the user submits '86.7 taco' and 92, the function should compare 86.7 and 92)

Pro Mode Example

`console.log(yourFunction('86.7 taco', 92));`
should log

`The second number was bigger!`
